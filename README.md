# Error Tracking Repo for Speech and Language Processing Book
This is an **UNOFFICIAL** repository for tracking the typos, errors and flaws in the book "Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition" by [Prof. Daniel Jurafsky](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/) and [Prof. James H. Martin](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/). The book is available for [free](http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) as an online resource and is also available for purchase at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Speech-Language-Processing-Introduction-Recognition/dp/0131873210) as a hardcopy (2nd edition).

The repository is to **share the information about the errors in the book with the community** before the next edition of the book is published. Since there is no connection between me and the authors of the book, errors should be reported to the authors directly using the email address provided on the book's website. Yet, people are free to use issues to discuss the errors and share their thoughts.

## How to contribute

If you find any errors in the book, please report them using the [issues](https://github.com/Saydemr/Speech-and-Language-Processing/issues). Please use the following template to report the errors:

```markdown
## Chapter: [Chapter Number] [Chapter Name]
## Page: [Page Number]
## Description: [Description of the error]
```

Feel free to attach screenshots to illustrate the errors and help the community better understand the location or nature of the error.
